# SoundMatching
Need to test this out again – it's been quite a few years. But there is a cool sound matching task here designed to test sensory integration capability of people with Parkinson's.
Shout out John-Stuart who guided me through this one. Creating this is probably where I made the biggest strides with Matlab. It requires quite a few toolboxes and importantly a USB dial and microphone and only worked on PC due to script interaction with hardware. I'd like to get this working again and perhaps modify into a web based programme that works across devices. We discussed doing this when setting up an online experiment but opted for a new visual illusion task instead because results from a sound-matching task completed by participants in their homes with their own set up was going to be too tricky – voice volume was the key variable but someone could be shouting and we might not know the difference between that and a whisper if they were standing 10 metres from the mic...

Maybe frequency might be the way to go...
